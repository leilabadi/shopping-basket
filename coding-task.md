Freemarket FX Software Engineer Candidate Coding Challenge
We would like you to develop a REST based Web API for an example online shopping basket that has the following features:
- Add an item to the basket
- Add multiple items to the basket
- Remove an item from the basket
- Add multiple of the same item to the basket
- Get the total cost for the basket (including 20% VAT)
- Get the total cost without VAT
- Add a discounted item to the basket
- Add a discount code to the basket (excluding discounted items)
- Add shipping cost to the UK
- Add shipping cost to other countries

For the solution, it should: 
- Be written in C#
- Use an in-memory store or database. If using a database then the ability to create/run the database should also be provided (e.g. SQL Script or Dockerfile)
- Have documentation about how the solution is set-up and run
- Be time limited to 4 hours development. Showing your understanding of software engineering techniques (code quality, structure, and decision-making) should be prioritised over implementing all of the features
- Be uploaded to a Git compatible online repository of your choice and the URL to the solution shared with Freemarket FX
