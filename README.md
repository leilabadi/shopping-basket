## Project Summary

### Implemented Features
- Complete shopping basket functionality: add/remove items, handle multiple quantities, apply product and basket discounts, calculate VAT, and manage shipping for UK and other countries.
- Clean architecture using domain-driven design, separation of concerns.
- Using modern C# features (record types, primary constructors, nullable references).
- In-memory, thread-safe repositories for data storage.
- Some input validation with FluentValidation.
- API with Swagger/OpenAPI.
- Unit tests for core business logic and services.

### Design Considerations
- Considered DDD and SOLID principles.
- Use of Repository, Factory and Service Layer patterns for maintainability and testability.
- Explicit result handling for clear error feedback and improved user experience.
- Modular structure for easy future enhancements and scalability.

### Suggested Improvements (not implemented due to time constraints)
- Adding endpoints to support more scenarios (e.g., bulk operations)
- More complex business logic (different discount types, inventory, multi-country tax).
- Covering all endpoints with full validation.
- Advanced error handling and structured logging.
- Persistent database integration (e.g., Entity Framework, SQL Server).
- Performance optimizations (caching, concurrency).
- Integration, end-to-end testing.
- Authentication and authorization for user-specific baskets.
